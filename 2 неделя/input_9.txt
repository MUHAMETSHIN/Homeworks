We all have some things we do every day or almost every day in a particular order. They are called “daily routine”. Let me tell you about my daily routine.

My typical day is quite busy, it begins at 6 o’clock in the morning when I wake up. When my alarm goes off, I turn it off, get up and make my bed. Then I take a shower, brush my teeth and do my morning workout. I do not exercise much in the morning, just a few simple exercises such as push-ups.

Usually, my mom makes breakfast for all of us, which is my parents and I. My older brother is a student and he lives in a dormitory. I have breakfast with my family. My father usually walks our dog, but when I have enough time, I like walking the dog myself.
